Hacking tool to edit memory on Monster Super League.
Can be easily converted to lach onto any apk through an emulator (I advise LDPlayer 9) by modifying the config file.
Scripts can be added without breaking modularity as long as they can be executed by frida.
Also includes my standalone executable as a rendering process (Built with chromium so I didnt have to recompile frida for electron), just serve different content if you want to adapt the UI.
Renderer has to be downloaded through the updater (As some files are too big for github)
